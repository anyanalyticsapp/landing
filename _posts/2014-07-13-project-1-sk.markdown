description: Selkeeper Tracker stores large amounts of data about user activity on the major local trading platforms. The challenge for Any Analytics team was to understand the domain, analyze structured and semistructured data generated by the service. Having received ideas and thoughts already existing in Selkeeper team our team generated analytical values to be calculated using the existing and living big data storage. We designed an analytics solution which was integrated into existing service infrastructure. From the very beggining of the project it was designed not to interrupt the general service workflow to avoid any possible negative impact on performance and stability. Analytics service is continiously extended to support the new analytical features of Selkeeper.
