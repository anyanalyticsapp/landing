description: The customer had a big data storage (around 2TB of semistructured data of global user activity) and wanted our team to make value from it. We executed exploratory analysis, generated more hundred pages report where we created multiple hypothesises on user activity, did statistical analysis and developed two analytical models. Also we implemented a deep learning prototype predicting the new feature which had a potential value for the customer.
